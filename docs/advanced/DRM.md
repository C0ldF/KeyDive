### **Core Concepts and Terms**  

#### **Certified Widevine Implementation Partner (CWIP)**  
The [CWIP program](https://support.google.com/widevine/answer/2938263?hl=en) ensures that individuals and organizations are equipped to install, configure, and troubleshoot Widevine DRM systems effectively. Key objectives of this program include:  
- Teaching candidates to implement Widevine systems with precision.  
- Enhancing satisfaction for integrators and end-users.  
- Ensuring trust among content owners.  

#### **Widevine Device Certificate Status List (DCSL)**  
The [Widevine DCSL](https://developers.google.com/widevine/drm/overview) provides a detailed list of certified devices, including:  
- **System ID**: A unique identifier for devices using Widevine.  
- **Security Level**: Defines the degree of hardware-based protection (e.g., L1, L2, or L3).  
- **Provisioning Method**: How keys and certificates are deployed (e.g., Factory Keybox).  
- **Device Type**: Identifies whether a device is a phone, set-top box, TV, etc.

### **Key Technical Terms**  

#### **Security Levels (L1, L2, L3)**  
Widevine security levels determine the degree of protection applied to content playback:  
- **L1**: Uses Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for all decryption and processing.  
- **L2**: Partially relies on the TEE but may use additional secure layers.  
- **L3**: Relies entirely on software-based protection, typically for devices without TEE.  

#### **Provisioning Methods**  
The way keys and certificates are securely delivered to devices:  
- **Factory Keybox**: Embedded during manufacturing to ensure hardware-level security.  
- **Device Provisioning**: Post-manufacturing certificate injection.  

#### **Content Encryption**  
Widevine utilizes standardized encryption methods, typically AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), to secure video streams.  

#### **DRM Key Types**  
- **Content Key**: Used to decrypt protected content.  
- **License Key**: Issued by the DRM license server to authorize content playback.
